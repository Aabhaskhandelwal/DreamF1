# Contributing to DreamF1

Thanks for considering a contribution — no PR is too small, and bug reports are just as valuable as code.

## Quick start

1. Fork the repo and clone it
2. Follow the [Quick Start](README.md#quick-start) in the README to get the app running locally (Docker one-liner, or backend/frontend separately)
3. Create a branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Open a PR — describe what changed and why

For bugs, open an [issue](https://github.com/Aabhaskhandelwal/DreamF1/issues) first if you're not fixing it yourself. For bigger ideas, open an issue or start a discussion before sinking a lot of time in — especially anything touching prediction scoring, since the rules have some subtlety (see Golden Rules below).

## Where to start

- Issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Aabhaskhandelwal/DreamF1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are scoped to be self-contained and don't require deep familiarity with the codebase.
- `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root is the full technical handoff doc — stack details, every API endpoint, the design system tokens, and a running incident log. It's the single source of truth for how this app is built and why. Worth reading before touching backend business logic.

## Stack

- **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend** (`backend/`) — FastAPI, SQLModel/SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Data** — [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/) for real session/telemetry data — all real 2026 results, no mocks
- **Prototype** (`frontend-prototype/`) — Streamlit reference build, kept for comparison, not the primary frontend

## The 4 golden rules of prediction logic

These are load-bearing — breaking them breaks the game for everyone using it:

1. **Strictly next race** — `POST /api/predict` never accepts an `event_id`; it always locks to the next unscored race. No race picker in the UI.
2. **Only 3-letter driver codes** — all driver inputs come from the hardcoded 22-driver dropdown list (`frontend/lib/design.ts`). No free text, ever.
3. **`is_completed` is not a UI signal** — it only flips after an admin manually triggers scoring (`POST /api/score/{event_id}`). Frontend "is this race done" logic must compare `event_date`, not read `is_completed`.
4. **Optional fields stay optional** — `dnf_driver`, `fourth_place`, `fifth_place`, `safety_car` are never required to submit a prediction.

Full detail on each is in `CLAUDE.md` section 6.

## Code style

- Match the existing patterns in the file you're editing before introducing a new one — the codebase leans dark-glassmorphism / DM Mono + Orbitron on the frontend, and FastAPI + SQLModel conventions on the backend.
- Don't add abstractions, config flags, or "just in case" error handling for scenarios that can't happen — keep changes scoped to what the issue actually asks for.
- Run the existing test suite (`cd backend && pytest tests/ -v`) and a frontend build (`cd frontend && npm run build`) before opening a PR.

## Questions

Open an issue with the `question` label, or comment on the relevant existing issue. Happy to talk through design decisions before you start.
